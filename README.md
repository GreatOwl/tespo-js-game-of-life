# tespo-js-game-of-life

These are not my strongest languages, but they are the best tools to do the job requested. I learned a lot from this test! However, I understand if my work does not meet your expectations as a result of this. I appreciate the opportunity that was given, and for the chance to learn from this.

## Dependencies

#### Docker
In order for the JS modules to load, they must be served from a web server. Please ensure you have Docker installed to run this.

#### Node, NPM, Typescript
This script utilizes node, npm and typescript. 

The build script will try install the Typescript cross compiler using NPM globally for the machine that runs it.

#### Bash
The build script uses bash, therefore it must be run on a nixy system, otherwise the equivalent commands in the script will need to be run manually from whatever prompt you have available.
